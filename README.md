Reverse-engineer all of this (EZ)

Not actually as easy as I thought. Reducing the scope from "reproduce his latest wall tile" to just the pin geometry.

Luckily, this pin has no 4-membered rings. Only 5-membered rings in the amorphous transition between crystal phases for the hooks. This means I can simulate Tom's geometry as-is with MM4. There are also no CNTs or pi bonds. That would be another thing precluding sharing of designs.

Also, because of the 5-membered rings, the mapping from diamond to silicon carbide is not trivial.

_Never underestimate the person-hours cost of real engineering._
